Buy @seed bread{} from LIDL, and cut it in 12mm slices. Toast the bread in a #toaster for ~{2%minutes}. Optionally , you can add @chives, @cream cheese{} or @mascarpone between the bread and the @smoked salmon{}.

Personally I store the bread in zip lock bags, with 6 slices per bag, and store in the freezer. Then, before use, you can just put in the toaster with the defrost mode on.
